252,F Uh  C but  if thats the case if the business is responsible for policing themselves then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that F uh  the opportunity  f   to forget that you owe sales tax for something F uh  can be avoided ,Uhhuh 
253, and  high heel shoes  ,I think  its   its  somewhat  a F uh  symptom of  our   me  generation

316,did not  get home that often D you know   ,did you keep getting that it was down 
317,I dont think theres so much of a problem there  ,the nursing homes when I was working in them were very much understaffed very much F uh  in need of good personnel F Uh   
318,I dont even get a regular newspaper  C and  F uh  because F uh   I  I  dont drive that much  , to mow about half of it throatclearing

329,C So  D you know  changing the oil changing the spark plugs  ,for instance  she  she  would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for D you know  when she made cookies  
330,especially when theyre young when they bring them in  ,howd you do that  
331,F Oh  how beautiful  ,thats  absolutely right  
332,C but  F uh  I feel that  its probably pre  its pretty   good  if  if  they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs ,C so   we  us kids   
333,C And  I have a nice size patio , nincompoop on trial  youd  youd  have to have

342,I dont care how  small the ballot is E I   ,Yeah  
343,C and  its so much easier than taking  that lawn spreader and   walking all over  , yeah  
344,F Oh  gee ,    
345,when theyre ten they have to live in it  ,C But   theyre   the ones that complain a lot are the first 
346, if youve  only got one ,C So    we  I   I  know

348,C But  F um  I think they took the dental  away now  ,Havent taken it yet though  
349, C And    F uh  C and   I think thats sad because that doesnt allow for any individuality ,C And  F uh  
350,C But  what Ive read about it they talk about that  ,C and  F uh  of course nothing ever goes down  
351,they dont have the ability to develop it ,the rest of the time you wonder D you know   could I use something else 
352,C and  I decided that was too much to tackle  ,Im still a full size person 
353, but uh a little dressing a little bit above the standard I think would uh pay off  ,D So  I dont know  
354,because my inner room looked so dingy,fooled with that checkbook D you know  laughter

1528,D Well   its kind of  its kind of  moved up  , D You know   that some of the  benefits I would rather have F um   money  
1529,I kno  ,D Well  another thing I think would be helpful would be to have some sort  of  of  say a national curriculum  Because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for F uh  curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California  
1530,C Because  one of my neighbors F uh   did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh ,Yeah  
1531, its    I   I  think its   probably more embarrassing and very painful ,Okay 
1532,D So  static , a big thing that I see   All that    most of the  most of the  women getting married now F uh   go back  have gone back to  D you know   
1533,I guess when I was growing up  it was  it was  still the ideal to  get a  get a  home and buy house  ,uhhuh

1540,It was wonderful ,C and  F uh  you see how  
1541,Havent seen that , Yeah   
1542,I think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and  the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground childcrying ,tennis lessons 
1543,C And  since I was just D you know  one of the office folk I guess it wasnt as important to them that they test me regularly  ,C and  you dont have to  
1544,I dont know if they could do it or not  ,if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers 
1545,Uhhuh ,C so  Im a little touchy throatclearing every now and then about  that laughter 
1546,Yeah ,Right 
1547,They said the musics great  ,Yeah  
1548,C And   that was  that was  not a good thing  , Uhhuh

1553, F Uh   now that Randalls coming back next season I hope theyll  be  do  a little bit better  ,C but   you know  they still  
1554, C and   C and   sometimes  weve gone  ,Laughter
1555, because you wont be able to with that ,Yeah 
1556,exactly   ,C So  I guess hes real laid back about it 
1557,Uhhuh , F uh  people be more eager mispronounced to do it 
1558,C So  thats where I work ,I F uh   
1559, and FLATLINERS   ,C and  it happened to be my friend who lives laughter a few blocks away 
1560, Right  , C so  that makes it very very nice  
1561,C but  if I wasnt doing that the money wouldnt be being saved anyway D you know   ,C But  thats what happens when you get up in this area D you know  you got all these companies are up here 
1562,F Uh  D you know   theyre a  theyre a   department store ,Uhhuh  
1563,F Um  C but  D you know  I suppose some places  are  are  more stringent about that than others , Theres

1574,Uhhuh ,Right  
1575,D like   F uh  its a big place  ,D So  
1576,Yeah  ,C and  I think thats the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault  
1577,C and   now since then D you know  the closer a car is to a fiftysix Buick  the  the  more I know about it , you both got to  they were

3276,her emotions  ,were going to go to somebody that we know  
3277,C And  even F um  F uh  police corps which started D you know  finding other breeds to use because  this thing   this  this  thing   known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability  was just terrible  ,I only heard about it

3294,Noise,Uhhuh

3296,Youre not casting a weight on the end of the line ,Weve been to F um  Chefalias  
3297,D Well  I watch more now because D well   I  I  had been going to school for years and have really been too busy  ,like it

3305,Right ,F uh  that is taking the middle of the afternoon  
3306, Im  Im  sure youve probably heard of Marion Berry ,do you  
3307,I really believe its because  ,C and   I have F uh  
3308,thats true  ,F Uh  C so    were   were  actually    were  pretty disciplined  
3309,D Well  C and  when I have my spare time laughter,C and  its kind of embarrassing  
3310,F Uh  F uh  what Im thinking about is back breathing D well  when I was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of  i  i   ,F um  what really bothers me is it just seems like  if  if   anyone were to say D you know  D well  Im going to raise taxes and cut the budget and   were       were   going to have to do some unpopular things E I mean  he wouldnt have a chance of getting elected 
3311,Uhhuh ,C but  F uh  I think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide 
3312,C or  what would be the features that you would be looking for ,down here its like two hundred dollars a day 
3313,C and  they have the Iowa Oaks  ,D Well  in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks laughter

3316,Uhhuh , thats fine  
3317,Just to be abused by the meanest waitress laughter slash unit,I really do faint 
3318,D Well  I have enjoyed it ,C and  Ive pretty much been home F uh  since Brian was born  
3319,yeah  ,Least with the jury you have twelve people D you know  
3320,Yeah  ,Does it  
3321,C and   they   they   send their kids to school  ,Uhhuh 
3322, from the news ,C So     you  you  assumed right laughter

3324,F Oh  D well ,Yep 
3325,for that you put ,C And  hope that we can stay in this situation laughter for awhile

3327,K U E N ,C Or  hes in the Dallas area 
3328,Thats fine  ,C and   Id say D well  Im going to leave the boat out because F uh  well probably do this again tomorrow laughter  
3329,I like the F uh   ,its necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly F uh  
3330,Even some of that I like okay ,C and  we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days 
3331,C and  I was picking up F uh  some background noise  , C So   C and   I would be glad to see that  
3332,C And so  the thing  is  is  that  I  I  can tell D like  F uh   ,C Because  around here theres really nothing for the young people  
3333,Mainly do reading  ,It still just seems a little twisted to me laughter 
3334,you have young children right ,C and  F um  some people dont like  that   that   film on the pudding  
3335,No  , C and so   
3336,C And   F uh  I guess for places I like  to go I enjoy going to the beach and   having  having outdoor   being outdoors  somewhere  , its not that big of a problem  
3337,C So  that just cuts even more ,C and  I was F uh  really shocked  at the amount of taxes I ended up paying  
3338,D well  I know both of my kids didnt want to live anywhere around  the  the  downtown areas ,C and  it has been a few years ago  
3339,Years  ,Right 
3340,there you can get D well   ,Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy  or  or  as a professional  nanny  nanny  as you put it F uh  
3341,Im in Dallas ,Breathing Yeah  
3342,C an   , to participate in  
3343,C and  I usually have kids around so I dont  end  end  up , for something like thirty years or something

3345, Its  its   phenomenal ,No  
3346, from   the teams that just run and gun ,being from California and wanting to hear D like   
3347, D you  know  like hundreds of gallons of water  , its   its  really strange  
3348,I dont  ,Right 
3349,it does so fast    ,Ive tried  
3350,Wow ,Why dont you do something with those  laughter  
3351, There would be sort of     moby   fish in a tank ,To watch them  
3352,C And  its not like the kids are going to go a lot longer  ,He F uh  was supposed to serve some time  
3353, is a very significant factor ,it was  human nature  
3354,Uhhuh ,Yeah  
3355,I have one of those  ,C and  here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when its snowing  
3356,youre just better off buying another car ,Okay 
3357,I dont care what anybody tells you ,F uh  D see  my sons eighteen right now  
3358,Uhhuh  ,the hell  
3359,F Um  D well  before we built our home we were  managing some apartments that ,No  
3360,Yes  , walk  in 
3361,C but  I just feel like if we didnt have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that  ,F Oh  thats nice 
3362,Yeah , I  I  wish I  would have bought the tape when I was  in F uh  Te  in Colorado   
3363, and  putting in panes of glass and stuff like that ,F Uh  D well  F uh  I have one daughter that works fulltime  
3364,C And  thats       ,In terms of the personal 
3365,C so  ,do you have  any  any  views on F uh  Israels relation to the U S  
3366, Yeah   ,And also through coupons  
3367,D Well  its  in  interesting  watching the different Soviet states Albania Lithuania doing their little revolts down there ,Right  
3368,Thats true ,no  
3369,we can get  a  D like  a  Caravan ,Uhhuh 
3370,C but  seems like the jury system  does have its advantages  ,D Well   my   my  real feeling   about   about  the purpose of undergraduate education is its really the time  
3371,D gosh  you can ride a bike laughter practically all the way to Southern Virginia ,Okay  
3372,you would   ,it really was  
3373,F Oh  my goodness these guys  they ,Uhhuh  
3374,Uhhuh ,Uhhuh 
3375,C so  I think ,no  
3376,Uhhuh , in the  house   
3377,C and  ,  I  F um  I   I   have both because  that  thats  what I use all the time is UNIX Systems  F Um  versus the DOS  
3378,They F uh   , E I mean   Im  not  not  saying at all that  Hussein wasnt quite willing to  ge   enter  that fight 
3379,In Panama theyve been used to Americans down there for so darn long  ,D Now  I havent seen it either  
3380,C and  she has flower gardens and bulbs perennials and things  ,C But   I like  I like   the older ones because at that time D you know  they were really futuristic D you know  
3381, boy  ,D you know  laughter childtalking 
3382,C but  those are the ones that are complaining A  I  I  think  a lot  ,C but  thats just  
3383,  you just   it hurts to breathe  ,C and  we got some great public works out of it  
3384,C and   I believe  that  D you know  that    I do believe that  capital punishment is F uh  alternative  ,you go first 
3385,throatclearing,C but  that was our general tendency anyway 
3386,As in metric size hole  or a  or an  American sized hole ,Ive only been camping twice 
3387, F uh   a professional singer  ,  I  
3388,   C S   C s    C so   you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system noise ,really 
3389,C and  its pretty large , That  that  had not occurred to me 
3390,C But  were ,F Uh  it  s just   D you know  doesnt  seem to have enough story to it 
3391,  I  I   I  dont ,Uhhuh 
3392,F Oh  yeah ,Im not sure where all my pins came from  
3393,F uh  my main opinion would be   w  w   we  should not have done it , C but  
3394,yeah childtalking  ,F Oh  okay  
3395,C but   ,Really  
3396,F Um  ye  ,C and  of course people are denying it  
3397, C so   finally laughter  ,C and  now
3398,like   the draft ,if they figure they have got it won or if theres no real hurry because the first three quarters or F uh   if  F uh  if   something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing   They say hey we got to do something now  And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes 
3399,C But  I have a hard time  of being able   of  separating  D you know   having a place   separating  my trash  ,is it restricted to certain crimes  
3400,Uhhuh ,Yeah 
3401,They say youre going to do it this way and thats the way its going to be , I think  I think  there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as F uh   
3402,I would too if I had kids  ,several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day 
3403,Uhhuh ,In fact on  weeknights they are in bed by eight  
3404, D Well  C but  D you know   the   the   strange thing   F uh  perhaps not strange but  something that many people dont realize  is that you can go back as far as nineteen fiftyone and fiftytwo and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids  ,I can understand that  
3405,F Um  I enjoy F uh  a lot of  the  the  modern forms F um  F uh  ,C and  F uh  we all look forward to it 
3406,Im not saying that they were,yeah laughter 
3407,right  ,uhhuh 
3408, I   I  see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it ,C but  hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day  
3409,F Uh  Dallas is having quite a few  ,Now  thats   its  all over with D you know  
3410, where were  ,Yeah 
3411,C but  F um  I dont know D you know   ,I started to see at home  
3412,D Well  theres so many people who have never D you know  even gotten to do that ,C and  I dont want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting  and so forth  
3413,Oh ,All those  old good ones that you D you know  wish they  had on  
3414,it is  ,Uhhuh 
3415,C but  F uh  thats how Im staying up , and  
3416,Laughter F Uh  ,Yeah  
3417,I would try that ,Uhhuh 
3418,Uhhuh , Byebye  
3419,Yeah  ,F um  I think that that would be  a real  a real  F uh  advantage  to  to  her to have that and F uh 
3420, C and  theyre all in boxes or bags  ,C because  D see  I didnt D see   
3421,C And  F uh  I guess we just like to go  someplace  someplace  entirely different  ,Right 
3422,C and  they cant decide for hours unless they convince that one person D you know  , C so   C But    D you know  it works I guess 
3423,Theres nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person  ,The prices D actually  a lot better because Pittsburgh is about the size A Ive been trying to think  like a Louisville or  Minneapolis that type of size 
3424,Oh laughter ,Uhhuh 
3425,Yeah ,C And then    you s  y   y   
3426,working on your own self ,C so  its kind of  a  a   typo that for than  unfair advantage
3427,Yeah ,yeah laughter 
3428,C And then  you think E I mean   I ha   E I mean  I can remember I have  not been out of school that long  , you  you  just have to  pick something for  the  the  group that youre going to entertain for that particular time 
3429,D Well  thats kind of what weve always been told D you know  theyll do  ,Yeah  
3430,     I am not for one world government  ,Really 
3431,On the other hand F um  I think theres certainly some professions that ought to be tested ,C and  they  
3432,Uhhuh ,Its just  thing   a part  of everyones consciousness 
3433,I run into people every day that cant speak English ,Uhhuh  
3434, Laughter We found this one area that doesnt have mosquitoes  ,Okay  
3435,C so  her budget is F uh  just F uh  planning for I R As ,C and  laughter  we just did  we would make   
3436,C But  probably F uh  D you know  more women being  in  in  the work force also greatly greatly affects social change ,D Well  F uh    yo    I    F uh  Im  kind of young  
3437,Right breathing ,Oh yeah  
3438,Uhhuh , Uhhuh   
3439,F Uh  clothes are getting  so expensive now  in  in  the stores  ,I think most of the time the kids are usually off  watching cartoons or playing video games or  stuff   stuff  like that 
3440, with them and so forth  ,right  
3441,Right  , Uhhuh   
3442,C and  I dont  have D you know  big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest  rate just is a killer ,Which is just F uh  in trouble 
3443,Smack  C So  I dont have a fear of fire arms in any respect ,I like to watch him 
3444,C and  I went  ,So were really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers 
3445,Do you watch L A LAW ,C So   I  Bush  is probably if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money  
3446,Uhhuh ,you have to be a certain income holder to F uh  have an American Express  card  
3447,I do  ,Okay  
3448,It was really nice ,C but  F uh  lipsmack I dont have F uh  Jack laughter standing behind me to tell me what to do laughter 
3449,F Um   it takes some  it takes some  dedication  to do it  , It  she thought it  was going to  
3450,A lot of the northern states and a lot of the Eastern states have bottles  ,Uhhuh 
3451,C And  I got about   two  twothirds  of it done , and if I am not going to D you know 
3452,The last  ,Dont they usually tell you to say something 
3453,theres a lot of people that are on death row, Uhhuh   
3454, I  I  guess I am disappointed with Dallas in that F uh  the fourteen one it  ,F uh  I find myself listening to popular music  
3455,C so  you cant use it anyway ,When we were  
3456,F Uh  the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to school is that  def  you have to early on define  what it is you want to do , when is it happening and where is it happening  
3457,Laughter,C or  were they reabsorbed  
3458,D You know  what wed really like  if   if   we just have  a   a  casual evening is Houstons  , Yeah  
3459,C But  D you know  same F uh   , Yep  
3460,Waco to me  seems  seems  like its pretty steady  ,Yeah  
3461,Uhhuh ,I didnt notice it  
3462,All right ,C so  D you know  they would be pretty elaborate 
3463, it gives you a different laughter perspective on what people do ,C But  F uh  thats great  
3464,course  when our  big ones were little we lived up north D you know   ,Right 
3465,Laughter,Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile  
3466,C So  I dont mow grass or anything like that  ,Take care 
3467, to us  ,I put in so much money each D you know  month towards long term savings D you know  like in F uh  mutual funds and things D you know  
3468,Yeah ,  there isnt  
3469,its very prevalent  ,Yeah  
3470, E I mean  you could go into a store and   get bombarded ,I think its because hes always heard music in our home  all the  since  he was a baby 
3471,Uhhuh , urban society   
3472,I could not believe it ,yes   
3473, Yeah  ,Yeah 
3474,F Uh  I like the Giants  ,C But    I  sigh it   it  seems to me that it still should  
3475,F Um  its just like up there when you hear its forty below its probably really only five below ,Uhhuh 
3476,Hart , Uhhuh   
3477, F huh  thats   ,Oh yeah 
3478, I  hardly ever watch it  ,the children thoroughly enjoy 
3479,C But  F uh  D you know  basically the guy commits D you know  three major crimes   and   and    F uh , before I  went to work and stuff  
3480,C and   they  theyre   making furniture and just D you know  things like  that during the winter  ,F Uh  we have two and another one on the way 
3481,Uhhuh , like  that  
3482,if we supported each other,when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought
3483,Uhhuh  ,that kind of  to me it is more like    vigilantism   
3484,C and  ,An English setter D you know   
3485,I do not ,C so  I was caught a little off guard  
3486,C but   it is ,Im sure until at least school age and maybe longer 
3487, C and  it is true  ,Yeah  
3488,D You know   I want to  I want to  throw some charcoal on the grill  and  and  throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and  stuff like that  ,Laughter
3489,Uhhuh ,Ive noticed people doing that down here too  
3490,yes maam ,C and   we   our whole house  has D you know   
3491,C and  F uh  ,Yeah   
3492, It is  it is  really scary ,Oh 
3493,Because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need ,Laughter Yeah  
3494,C and  I thought D wow  that might be interesting ,D You know  every time you do that it F uh  kind of kills the tree for a while 
3495,Even when you tell them no they keep calling back , teaches  teaches  a lot  
3496,in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night ,D Well   Charles will actually    Charles will  not smoke in anyone elses house except our own 
3497, hes ,C so   F Um  anyway let me press one 
3498,F Oh  good idea ,Its what information is presented  
3499,C Because   that   that  just reminds me of D you know  D like  back in school  , It does  
3500,C but  I dont know what they can do to really prevent it D you know   ,Im ready when you are 
3501,C but  F uh  football  soon as its fall then he likes ,F Huh   
3502,C but  F um    if you   F um     if   if     you    want to go into one thats really useful breathing youre going to have to go over a thousand dollars  ,Laughter
3503,F Uh  what are you thinking about buying ,Huh 
3504, was a friend that you know did it in hum sounds like an airplane their house that I knew well ,Uhhuh 
3505, we cant  we cant  balance a checkbook without a calculator ,C And  F uh  D you know  you could do a lot of it yourself still  
3506,D Well   what  what  changes  would you   have you considered F uh  in doing it  to  to  your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better ,Yeah  
3507, C And   C  and   F uh  then an uncle is dead  ,E I mean  its not so serious I guess until it affects your family  
3508,C and  the idea that D you know   if he got in trouble theres  some   some  ways of getting out and that he doesnt  have to carry cash  ,Yeah 
3509,Uhhuh ,Laughter Not always  
3510,I dont know ,Are you from Dallas area 
3511,D Actually   they were  the guy was  pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A ,we use my husbands 
3512,C And so   it   it  works out nice  ,Definitely when its cool 
3513,youre right  ,C But  we have F uh   
3514,Yeah ,C But  it turns out that F uh  Foster actually F uh  ghost wrote it for him 
3515,C but  F uh  D you know ,Throatclearing
3516,Right ,Yeah  
3517,I always thought itd be great to have twins , the facts would probably back it up  
3518,Uh the causes of crime  ,I   Im   just read two books  
3519,F Uh  automatically  ,Uhhuh 
3520,C so   he went  D like  F uh  I think he went  D well  five mornings a week if I remember correctly ,It was F uh  several years  ago  
3521,Uhhuh ,C so  about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too D you know  
3522,breathing F uh  C but  it does have a word processing program which all of us have used for breathing  re  reports  and papers and that sort of thing ,Thats true  
3523,Thats true , D Like  F uh    
3524,Uhhuh , really hard   because    to  to  really to get help

3712, I think  I think  helping us be more  enthu  enthusiastic  about it,F Uh  D well  I have F uh  seen DANCES WITH WOLVES which is probably  the  the   best movie that I have seen lately  
3713,E I mean  ,They still show MISTER ROGERS

4105,C And  E I mean  I was out of  school  ,obstinate 
4106,that ,Right

4127,Right , then it just kills them cause they cant stand the hot weather 
4128,C and  I guess guys can take advantage of that  ,Uhhuh

4739,In Durham which is right next to Raleigh ,That I dont think I could do anyway  
4740,C so  D you know  I think that   it   a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket  ,We got free tickets because  someone at our church    one of the deacons at church  F um  parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek  which is D like  one of  the   F uh  the  places and stuff

4753,Yes ,C And then  when you get one of those tornado type 
4754, its  its  a gamble  ,Theyre not going to change that to meters  
4755,C So  there was no repercussion at all  D You know  other than insurance  ,I guess it just depends on how they manage it 
4756, F Uh   C and    C and    D you know  some people might not believe that  ,F Um   I  
4757,If you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer D you know  cause those are risk factors  ,C so  I cant say that

5328, kind of thing ,Uhhuh  
5329, Right  ,Pretty good 
5330,C but  its a charity for the benefit of this shelter ,C and  I think  if  F uh  if  we just start to put D you know  the nickel deposit on things like F uh  was the case years ago that F uh  it would have more immediate effect F uh   than    
5331,Thats right ,and theyd give me  
5332,C and  all that does  is lawlessness  ,I really never had anything major with my Mazda

5924, that work and the percentage  of hours that they work and how that affects their grades  ,F Uh  I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the  mi  military  off and on  over the  over the   years of being called back and things of that nature is F uh   Ive found that D you know  theres an extraordinary amount of waste  
5925,ignore the others , I stay wi  I have to stay within   it

5933,C but  theyve had up those for quite a while  ,Okay

5940, Right  ,C so  if you have  
5941,You have to be a very unselfish person  to  to  spend a lot of time with your kids I  think  ,yeah 
5942,but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state ,Thats cheaper than we pay

5960,Our district did that for the ninetyone and the ninety  school year  E or  calendar years   ,Do you think that T V is F uh  pretty accurate  
5961,now that theres just a million rap groups  , F uh   was basic in a D you know    middle  upper middle  class area  
5962, C or    C or    they dont serve very much of the time  , D So   D so   you went to school then in

5972,C So  at least theyre moving that direction ,I  thought Id grab one of these days  
5973, C But    C but   it is hard once they get that age  ,Is that right 
5974,C and  what he ,For some reason I just couldnt do it 
5975,F Oh  my gosh  ,No  
5976, and   he always did it through rhetoric ,I dont have anything to worry about  
5977, not so here in Texas , Yeah  
5978, C So  what  ,Laughter  Okay  then  
5979,D Well  the only F uh  references that I have seen lately has been F uh  in part of  , we made a higher and a lower  
5980,where we are right now there are very few trees ,C and  when I was looking for the nursing homes another thing that I learned F uh   
5981,Uhhuh ,Child 
5982,D Well  you ,D Well  great 
5983,Uhhuh ,Uhhuh 
5984,C And then  I have one that F uh  just gave me the pin number automatically ,Uhhuh  
5985,Especially,  that and school its not   
5986,C and  now theyre stuck with the bill  , C and   C because   I dont know of any other countries that are doing this  
5987,they thought that was so hysterical ,Yeah 
5988,Thats interesting ,Yeah 
5989, its  F uh  it    ,C and  it really damaged the corn  
5990,C But   F uh  ,All I had was sweats  
5991,When theyre so cheap too at the video stores that you can ,F Oh  thats a good size 
5992,Bye clicking ,C so  we do a lot of boating on 
5993,C and  he was    a  d   d    a District  Attorney before and a prosecutor before   becoming  becoming   mayor  ,C but  the local  newspaper really goes into F uh  quite a bit of history about the candidate  
5994,Laughter, got to 
5995, I  Ive   been thinking about that for years F uh  ,Vivaldi is probably my favorite F uh  composer 
5996,C and then  on the other hand Ive seen some people  go into the nursing home and just so  happy ,have you participated in anything like that 
5997,C cause   his   my  brother plays  ,Breathing C and  Ill tell you how they handled this  
5998,C But  even just social visits people dont do that anymore  ,and roads is falling apart 
5999,That would be good for a dinner party  that   D you know  to cook that  because you dont have to deal with eight different things,Do you know anybody thats ever done this 
6000, Yeah  ,Right  
6001, D So   ,Ive just been so busy F uh  
6002,Uhhuh ,Youre aware of that Im sure 
6003,C but  I really feel  that  that  Im just getting overtaxed ,I was going to say because with six  people how do you F um   
6004,No ,No  
6005,this is crummy ,D So  how do you go  
6006,Theyre winning   fortyone to seven ,C and then  you let it  simmer  
6007,Where they couldnt do that  ,Yeah 
6008,Sure  ,It seems to me that Im more uncomfortable  
6009,I think that that  would  would  help a lot  ,   It  its    
6010,C but  it wasnt the trumpet laughter , C and   
6011, Exactly   ,F Uh  laughter in fact I dont know if I could have F uh  held up F uh  D you know  without my wife F uh  helping  in   this  
6012,D Well  I suppose you may be right on that ,It was 
6013,Im a pediatrician , or lunches  
6014,I like to knit  , D you  know   
6015,C so  laughter , everyones D you know  
6016,Its hard to accept the fact that youre unable to pursue life throatclearing at the level that you did before  ,Because theyre enclosed  
6017,Uhhuh ,C So   we try to hit those places when we can 
6018,C and  then they changed the game ,We were going to go for ten weeks F uh 
6019,Uhhuh  ,C And so  F uh  because based on the number of children and the amount of money F uh  my father brought in I got a small grant  
6020,F Uh  although we F uh  use to set some F uh  trout lines out  ,C and  we get students that come in that have been  kicked out of the F uh  parochial   and  pub   and  F uh  private  schools

6026,Do you ,Yeah noise  
6027,C so  thats  no   no   big   thing  ,like I say theyre  kind of   just kind of  more   sturdy    than anything D you know   
6028,C and  they hit their dogs and try to  ,Noise
6029,C But  F uh    its  its   been quite an adventure  ,Oh 
6030, Ive  Ive  kind of formed the attitude that D you know   if I could just  if I could  pick two or three shots  out  F uh  out  of my game every time and put them together on one hole then I do pretty good  , F Oh  of course   
6031,E I mean   th    some of them are even allowed to work  ,D Well  I expected something to leak D you know  
6032,Nothing  ,Yeah 
6033,right ,Yeah 
6034,A I dont think  Im trying to think if its much local  ,C and  I noticed I was spending less and  less time with them

6593,Laughter,C And  that movie  I have to   Ill  fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is  
6594,All right ,You found some members of your church that had been murdered 
6595,I guess your dress changes ,its great  
6596, tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour       , Sure   
6597,C or  after tax year nineteen ninety theres no deductions for D you know   credit card interest that you pay ,C And  I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay  home and maybe be wage earners for their family  
6598,D You know  E I mean    I  I   Ive  never liked credit cards , C but

6606,C And  it was ,this morning in our paper  it   there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a drivers license  
6607,we were thinking about getting   cat  ,Theyre uh they almost have what I would call a killer e killer bee instinct

7458,What if we totally  took money out of the camp  F eh   ma   just severely limited the campaigns so money wasnt so much of an issue  , Laughter  What are these things

7554,F Uh  D you know  to  ,Funny how that works isnt it laughter 
7555, Thats  from the childs standpoint  ,Ye  
7556,F Um  there are many reasons for it  ,E I mean  F w  F well   they are the people whose strings are pulled and by I guess powerful intere 
7557,Newspapers  ,C But  if we did we certainly should have supported  our people who were there 
7558,C but  then theres these F um  periods like early fall before Christmas or  early spring when theres sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again it F uh  will increase the revenues from the movie ,We didnt do much to it at all

8319,F Um  ,Weve got enough  without lea  without  a passport  
8320,Yeah ,Uhhuh

9112,D Well  its been nice talking with you ,C and  thats been real good 
9113,Yeah  ,F Uh  generally F uh  I think its been as  high as about a hundred and twenty people 
9114,just besides the fact that you know your when your child gets out of school at three oclock and then has to wait ,Sure 
9115,Yeah ,Sometimes its to  sup   help support  college D you know

9132,There you go ,D Well   we probably  have we  talked long enough  
9133,Throatclearing  Really  ,me alone  
9134,C and  one thing I thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he F uh   scanned across the little bar code ,the reason why we got that is we had had a Nova  
9135,F um  I think  the big   the biggest   problem Ive got  is   is  forcing it on someone after theyve already agreed to the terms of employment ,they cant keep force feeding things to each other   and 
9136,Uhhuh , out of my  payroll 
9137,yeah ,SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat

9148, even  suburban no matter where you are  ,Yeah  
9149, Tha  ,C and  she said that she didnt want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in Saudi Arabia she wouldnt want to know D you know  that theyre bombing  or  or  this and thats going on  
9150,C But   F uh  its the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad  ,D Well  
9151,Really ,what I dont know is where do we draw the line 
9152,Well thats thats what I was about to say  ,C but  I didnt get elected on the panel

9173,That is an army  ,C and  I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered  
9174,In that it seems to me that they are swayed more by  emotion than F uh  by evidence thats presented  ,C And  I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the F uh  early decisions of the Vietnam war That the F uh  throatclearing people saw the cold war as F uh  you had to draw a line  and   and  defend it  
9175,F Oh  yeah ,C but  as long as my oldest aunt lived we we got together once a year

9230,Yeah  ,D well  it depends on where you are

10410,they have to be home by such and such a time  , C and   C and   that it is  a  inhaling a   l  loss   I  I  think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism   ju  just  to do  just  that    in or  in order  to  gain the revenue thats being lost  
10411,They have offices that are too well  insulated  ,What the quality
