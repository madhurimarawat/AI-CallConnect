C and  I decided that was too much to tackle  ,Im still a full size person 
 but uh a little dressing a little bit above the standard I think would uh pay off  ,D So  I dont know

C But  they were wrong  ,I think all of  
  that was  that   that  might be one of my all time favorites too  ,D Well  noise the  
There is not really a lot to fight over  , C And  it very very hard  mispronounced for them to accept that 
I dont know ,I used  to live in Dallas   In Arlington actually

 Washington  , F Uh

D Well   its kind of  its kind of  moved up  , D You know   that some of the  benefits I would rather have F um   money  
I kno  ,D Well  another thing I think would be helpful would be to have some sort  of  of  say a national curriculum  Because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for F uh  curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California  
C Because  one of my neighbors F uh   did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh ,Yeah  
 its    I   I  think its   probably more embarrassing and very painful ,Okay 
D So  static , a big thing that I see   All that    most of the  most of the  women getting married now F uh   go back  have gone back to  D you know   
I guess when I was growing up  it was  it was  still the ideal to  get a  get a  home and buy house  ,uhhuh

C And  since I was just D you know  one of the office folk I guess it wasnt as important to them that they test me regularly  ,C and  you dont have to

F Uh  D you know   theyre a  theyre a   department store ,Uhhuh  
F Um  C but  D you know  I suppose some places  are  are  more stringent about that than others , Theres 
If youre D you know  a brick layer somebody can look and see D you know  D well    D yeah   you laid D you know  fifteen thousand bricks today  ,F Oh  I see

Uhhuh ,Right  
D like   F uh  its a big place  ,D So  
Yeah  ,C and  I think thats the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault  
C and   now since then D you know  the closer a car is to a fiftysix Buick  the  the  more I know about it , you both got to  they were

Is that how they did it ,Uhhuh 
  We  our   our   initial goal was just to  retire debt  F uh   completely retire debt  for car payments and ,C so   even if I  I think even if I    had  F uh  had  kept the warranty the service agreements were with the companies  that  that  manufactured  
E or  a quarter acre away  rather ,F Um  where D you know  he then they waited a  couple years

Laughter, C or    F um  C and   I think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would  
 around the house or it makes it worse  ,Laughter C So  I thought that was  really interesting the way that they did that  
Right  ,C but  its too costly for us  
Oka ,F Uh  C so  you have children I take it 
to be a problem ,Uhhuh  
they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham whos just D you know  phenomenal  ,C and  Im not sure what can be done to ensure that they dont  
thats true  ,C But  I believe that theres definitely a basic perception and  image problem with the fact of even being a teacher 
Yes  , Why

C So  how are you supposed to expect to stay  number one when youre behind the times in technology ,Uhhuh

C and then  financially they got themselves into D well  Ill have the boat  ,If you say no then youre excluded  
 I dont  I dont  like having credit cards for  every store  , Im sure  
That is one of the strangest areas I have ever seen , that was  some of  
 C and  I realize its my fault  ,y  
C and  we had things in inside pockets and  in  D you know  in  jacket  underneath a coat type of thing ,C And so  that ended that
Ive been wanting to take an F um  oriental cooking class  ,Ive only been married less than two years  
F Uh   ,Africa

 F uh  the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that I put on it were F uh  not even cast aluminum  ,Yep  
F Oh  yeah  ,Okay 
 C and  so  what we did was draw up a budget that we thought F uh  was realistic ,great detail 
I think so laughter ,C and  that involves both Canadian
C but  certainly I cant understand not calling the police , one of those  F uh   course one of the  shows I saw was taking it from the angle that since it doesnt effect men its not going to get funded  
C and so   I  I  camped a lot in F um  the Middle East  ,C and  they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions  
and running across D like   F uh  the old gods and things ,F Oh  D well thats pretty good  
F Uh  I have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki,I love the culture F uh   the way that  they  F uh  they  respect education and their teachers

C So  its mostly all novels ,sure 
C and  to get into the systems very difficult  ,I just got the bicycle out today  
 it  really D you know  ultimately is not penalizing the person that theyre trying for get away ,C and  they came back  
That really ticks me off  , One   one  F uh  absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly  D you know  serious subject 
C but  ,Yeah 
C and  he always refers to it as shortterm pleasure oriented ,C But  they showed  these rooms  on   F uh  D you know  on  the news

What work are you in ,D So  whispering 
No , I  I  think that D like  girls today have children

 I   I  know of some people  who did F uh   ,C and so  
 They  were following him home from the motorcycle shop ,in their history

C and  F uh  apparently a number of them have been participating , to get  him involved in stuff like that  
F Um  I ended up going through a credit counseling service , on  regular stations 
if you have one child or  fewer you get involved in organized events  or ,D like  they have apartment styles  
C and   when he  when we  ask him  he  F uh  he  barks  ,C But  F uh   I  I  think he kind of follows the sports

Yeah  ,No   
D Well  I know  as I  as I  said our house is about seventeen years old  ,Uhhuh 
Thats too much trouble  ,Thats right 
F Uh  C and then   I  I  hope to be able to form my own opinion of it  , its something like that  
 Is that right  ,There always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere 
hooked on D you know  D like   , certainly comparable 
 C and  I finally was  ,C But  people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days

C but  throatclearing I just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens ,Yeah

E I mean  the F uh  documentary the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that  ,its  
once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree he had to take out some loans  , yeah  
Thats kind of a,C and  they  get them  get them  early parole in order to make rooms for  the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks  
Thats great  ,Uhhuh 
D So    I  I   E I mean    as  as  man has gotten more complicated so all of the F uh  imaginations to F uh  D you know  protect him  from  from  being F uh  dumped on by F uh  civilian authority   in  in so   in criminal actions  especially D you know   murder cases and that sort of thing ,C and  they wrote that its kind of weird laughter  
C And so   we could  we could   talk about F uh  that path D you know  how important you think his benefits are      And  and   and  F uh  how important you think they are and  if   what would you like to see increased ,Yeah

C but  mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring  and  and   just going out and  seeing what there was to see F uh  in the area ,F Uh  this  
Yep ,to tell you the truth F um  I think that if you can keep  that  that way  D you know  kind of like a homestead 
C But   F uh  they F uh   ,yeah 
C and  one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,F Oh  okay 
Okay  ,It starts in F uh  March as a rule

C and  our baby lives just a mile over the hill laughter,I believe thats right 
F Oh  C but  thats nice D you know   ,They F uh

Cooking chocolate ,C and  the pansies looked terrible  but they came back later  
I cant remember who it was  ,Uhhuh 
Right ,Im  from North Carolina 
C And  when youve got candidates as you do  , C And   C so    D now   I  I   feel lucky D actually  because Ive almost lived around everyone  
There are a couple of things I think we need to really work for  ,Yeah  
 C and   C and   they had been fishing and let him use the pole while  we wal  we all   walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish ,D Well   its  its  not too bad  
F Uh  C and  also  I  D you know  I  try to save a certain amount each month as well  ,what kind of things do you think can be done   in  in   F uh  in  the long term 
F Oh  God no laughter ,C And  I think business got in the way  
 F uh  no problem at all  , they wouldnt sue a one of them
 and most  ,C but  D you know  it sure beats driving a thousand miles   to laughter  to  find a mountain I guess 
Laughter F Uh  D well  F uh  yeah  ,C And  F um  normally  what happ  what we   do is F um  just D you know  like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil C or  some other type of oil  than just regular  oi  vegetable oil   
C And then  if you want popcorn and stuff ,  their income  has slow 
 C and   F uh  C but   F uh  the cousins are closer to our daughters age   and   than to our sons and just totally different, Uhhuh  
Its vacations Christmas ,Laughter
C And  we were just F um  not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle ,C and  I dont know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one 
 Yeah  ,Yeah 
Uhhuh  , C and so    it really helps our garden  
You set down  ,I just havent F uh  really tried a whole lot  
F Oh  D well  does a boar taste just like regular ham ,D Well  lawyers help create that laughter 
F Oh  yeah  , When I call  
The ones that blink off and on ,Im sure they are 
its really nice ,  And  and    its all there 
C and so  , they won by  two points  
Right , Mainly because I  a lot of it has to do I  think with more women working  
 there was no  there was no  comparison  F Uh   , because I dont really go out to dinner  that much  
Oh is it ,Laughter  Uhhuh laughter 
Okay ,I saw James Doohan D you know  the guy  that plays F uh  Scotty 
it takes us about a year to save up enough to be  worth  D you know  worth  bothering to go in and do  ,Uhhuh 
C and so  she has a lot of school programs and things like that ,in the office with the different programs   and      any trouble shooting that there is 
it just  makes it very pliable  and ,Okay  
I did F uh  ,You too 
C and   she had  F uh   there were seven kids in her  family ,Pump  yeah should this be two slash units
Yeah ,Thats true  
Youre not seeing D you know   ,One of the calls Id gotten before was F uh  down to Austin

 I  I  always  wondered about that myself , Or  flex time or something that was  a little more personal D you know  
C And  they took it more as  just D like  a majority ,bah humbug  
F Oh  yeah  ,Yeah  
We like surprises  ,Hence the savings and loan problem we have 
that can be awful ,I had wanderlust  
 unless you    unless you  have some vacation time or  some   some  sick leave or whatever F um  you kind  of have to finagle your way around to get that time ,and that is the effects of acid rain
C and  she said You cant do that ,Yeah 
D You know  this is like a cruelty joke  ,and the wrong objects in there  
We never had it you know  ,Uhhuh

 C but  F uh  we feel real fortunate  ,Him and his wife are getting divorced

C but  I just am scared of capital punishment,Yeah 
 He   hes   very conscious  of   of  passive smoking  ,Uhhuh  
Ive just always like the Boston Celtics  ,yes

C And  even  as  as  light as that is with F uh  the small tires  its  its  done pretty well ,have you established  what kind of requirements you are looking  for   for  your next vehicle 
Goodbye ,I hope that happens in my case 
Whats that ,C and then   they feel an obligation to respond even though theres not even a person there 
yeah , C and   C but   I think ones that dont have to the  
D like  my inlaws also had a camper  or F uh  a pop up tent  D you know  one of those trailer tops  ,C So    there  theres   its  possible that there is a person in Plano that doesnt buy any of those three things and therefore wouldnt have 
if I was looking for outside care I probably would stay away from professional  child care centers and try to find if I was close to home relatives or people with   it is   same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised  in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes  as  as  parents ,F Oh  laughter what kind of work do you do on it

Yeah ,Right  
F Uh  probably Spring  , around this block area  
They have F um  screened in areas D you know   ,C and  save specialization I guess for graduate school unless theyre sure  they want  early on they want  to do something like engineering or something

With a big stick  ,Yeah 
C because  I remember my brother,Yes  
C but   again  its not typical in this area  ,Uhhuh

C And so  she asks the same questions over and over again  Which is not  un  D you know  unrealistic  , isnt  isnt  there a plan now to make a command center there or something 
C and  around here the big spicy thing is D like  F uh  buffalo wings  , D you know  which they did

 Right  , You can actually

Laughter      ,C and  it takes some drastic steps at this point  
Uhhuh ,C but   Im  D you know   
   C and    ,C And so  she knew that I had the time and  would be  would  enjoy it

I dont use any poison either ,C and  D you know    it  it   it   rained through half the F um  tournament so people had to        
Uhhuh ,as they all do 
C and then   w  after five minutes  when  the F uh  F uh  voice comes on we can talk all night if we want  laughter  ,compared to the Japanese
 that charges it  ,Seems like theres so many kids that  dont have any cough since of D you know  what they want to be or do  
We do a lot of that  ,Ive been around to a few other countries  
D well  I shouldnt say the only time  ,C so  its a brand new book 
Yeah ,Im not sure how long theyre supposed to be  
D Well  thats right  ,Yeah  
 Yeah  ,We keep a large plastic F uh    just a  D you know  a    garbage bag in the garage 
C and    I   I    when I  was in school it was always  the tired   the tired  excuse  that we went to war to save us against communism  ,Uhhuh  
 its really  sad because theyre not doing anything  ,talking thats true  
Uhhuh ,Its like a mill D you know   
Yes maam ,C And  I know that theres a glass plant up here  
D Well  theres someplace D you know   ,Hes like a semigovernment type agent  Who  goes out then to  F uh  works for  the Phoenix Foundation supposedly 
I dont think its very t  ,Uh its al its a lot of it is who looks the best who uh who happens to say the right thing at the right time who not who may not be the most qualified and can get the b uh the job done 
I just got her back from the vet this morning getting her spayed  ,I dont  
C and   F uh  they  ,allow them to  F uh  go back  and  and  deliberate  C and  F uh  D you know  after each days proceedings come out  with some questions that they want answered like the next day bring those people back 
Yeah ,Sometimes we have really good luck with them  
 I couldnt believe that F huh  ,That is very inconvenient 
 C But  ,C and  people are talking  about  about  the current space program all the time  
or  ,D You know  they give you an opportunity  to either transfer into an  on going   on going  project 
Dishes,Yeah  
I guess that I guess you consider just things that every day that would you would think of about  , thats where  my fam   my inlaws  are 
her emotions  ,were going to go to somebody that we know  
C And  even F um  F uh  police corps which started D you know  finding other breeds to use because  this thing   this  this  thing   known as a German shepherd here its personality and its dependability and its reliability  was just terrible  ,I only heard about it 
Yeah ,C But  James and I like  
Of course  ,The blackening is really the seasoning 
 do we get  the news that we want  ,C but  
 C and  the reason I got a standard was because I thought it handled a lot better  ,  I   I  can see  
Uhhuh ,Uhhuh 
F Uh  C so  that  ,F Oh  D well  thats good too 
 Its  I think its  mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high ,You dont even have to have a good rod or  anything  Just  just  even a regular line  
I wanted to be a high school band director ,yeah 
 The  the  responsibility of that  ,C And  we get upgraded  
I think thats true ,F Oh  mine had a very short fuse  
F Oh  really ,this one  
Laughter Yes  ,Oh 
Yeah  , my  my  daughter was living at home then  
 Uhhuh  ,Yeah 
They cannot close off the Mexican border  Not because its physically impossible  but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico  would be  F uh  F uh ,I have used F uh  Word Perfect  
If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries  that are so poor that they wouldnt be able to really D you know  send children to do that , And said   D well  well cancel it  just like they did to  the   that Polish debt here F uh  last week 
Noise,Uhhuh 
C so  ,C and so  my kids do not F uh  have an TV 
Youre not casting a weight on the end of the line ,Weve been to F um  Chefalias  
D Well  I watch more now because D well   I  I  had been going to school for years and have really been too busy  ,like it 
F Um   weve  been  D well  weve been  to Wyoming D you know  and Kentucky and Montana and D you know   places like that  ,Income 
Uhhuh ,we painted the bedroom F uh  well within the last  t   couple of months 
 you  shouldnt be ,D You know  I just  
D Well  it just its so discouraging that  they cant really  ,C So  its kind of  F uh   
C and   we did it   ,F Huh  thats really  funny laughter  
D Well  F uh   the  the  only  I can  I wa  D you know   ,  C So    C but     we  weve  tried   weve tried  everything  
F Oh  of everything ,Otherwise  you can  F uh  lipsmack guess you can    put  also put money   hold money  back and then either use or lose it A and that doesnt get taxed  or can just have that money D you know  put in your paycheck 
Right ,F uh  that is taking the middle of the afternoon  
 Im  Im  sure youve probably heard of Marion Berry ,do you  
I really believe its because  ,C and   I have F uh  
thats true  ,F Uh  C so    were   were  actually    were  pretty disciplined  
D Well  C and  when I have my spare time laughter,C and  its kind of embarrassing  
F Uh  F uh  what Im thinking about is back breathing D well  when I was a kid and much earlier than that kids were kind of  i  i   ,F um  what really bothers me is it just seems like  if  if   anyone were to say D you know  D well  Im going to raise taxes and cut the budget and   were       were   going to have to do some unpopular things E I mean  he wouldnt have a chance of getting elected 
Uhhuh ,C but  F uh  I think it works better than many other systems like having a judge decide 
C or  what would be the features that you would be looking for ,down here its like two hundred dollars a day 
C and  they have the Iowa Oaks  ,D Well  in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks laughter 
One is you often see in the headlines the big numbers ,C And   F uh  we went fishing there  last memorial day   Memorial Day
I was three when we moved back here ,C And then  they cant meet the minimum  monthly payments on it 
Uhhuh , thats fine  
Just to be abused by the meanest waitress laughter slash unit,I really do faint 
D Well  I have enjoyed it ,C and  Ive pretty much been home F uh  since Brian was born  
yeah  ,Least with the jury you have twelve people D you know  
Yeah  ,Does it  
C and   they   they   send their kids to school  ,Uhhuh 
 from the news ,C So     you  you  assumed right laughter  
laughter I really can  ,E I mean  if you ever start looking in papers now and you start seeing these ads for German Shepherds they will say on them bred for disposition A K C   conforming   
F Oh  D well ,Yep 
for that you put ,C And  hope that we can stay in this situation laughter for awhile  
 Its pretty  its pretty   cute  ,C because   I think  D you know  as a child growing up I think  is a task that belongs to his parents 
K U E N ,C Or  hes in the Dallas area 
Thats fine  ,C and   Id say D well  Im going to leave the boat out because F uh  well probably do this again tomorrow laughter  
I like the F uh   ,its necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly F uh  
Even some of that I like okay ,C and  we went down to Cape Hatteras for a few days 
C and  I was picking up F uh  some background noise  , C So   C and   I would be glad to see that  
C And so  the thing  is  is  that  I  I  can tell D like  F uh   ,C Because  around here theres really nothing for the young people  
Mainly do reading  ,It still just seems a little twisted to me laughter 
you have young children right ,C and  F um  some people dont like  that   that   film on the pudding  
No  , C and so   
C And   F uh  I guess for places I like  to go I enjoy going to the beach and   having  having outdoor   being outdoors  somewhere  , its not that big of a problem  
C So  that just cuts even more ,C and  I was F uh  really shocked  at the amount of taxes I ended up paying  
D well  I know both of my kids didnt want to live anywhere around  the  the  downtown areas ,C and  it has been a few years ago  
Years  ,Right 
there you can get D well   ,Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy  or  or  as a professional  nanny  nanny  as you put it F uh  
Im in Dallas ,Breathing Yeah  
C an   , to participate in  
C and  I usually have kids around so I dont  end  end  up , for something like thirty years or something  
 some things  ,We just kind of  save everything  for when   Al    F uh   for  for  when his Dad   comes to visit  
 Its  its   phenomenal ,No  
 from   the teams that just run and gun ,being from California and wanting to hear D like   
 D you  know  like hundreds of gallons of water  , its   its  really strange  
I dont  ,Right 
it does so fast    ,Ive tried  
Wow ,Why dont you do something with those  laughter  
 There would be sort of     moby   fish in a tank ,To watch them  
C And  its not like the kids are going to go a lot longer  ,He F uh  was supposed to serve some time  
 is a very significant factor ,it was  human nature  
Uhhuh ,Yeah  
I have one of those  ,C and  here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when its snowing  
youre just better off buying another car ,Okay 
I dont care what anybody tells you ,F uh  D see  my sons eighteen right now  
Uhhuh  ,the hell  
F Um  D well  before we built our home we were  managing some apartments that ,No  
Yes  , walk  in 
C but  I just feel like if we didnt have those loans we could have saved in the last five years the money for that  ,F Oh  thats nice 
Yeah , I  I  wish I  would have bought the tape when I was  in F uh  Te  in Colorado   
 and  putting in panes of glass and stuff like that ,F Uh  D well  F uh  I have one daughter that works fulltime  
C And  thats       ,In terms of the personal 
C so  ,do you have  any  any  views on F uh  Israels relation to the U S  
 Yeah   ,And also through coupons  
D Well  its  in  interesting  watching the different Soviet states Albania Lithuania doing their little revolts down there ,Right  
Thats true ,no  
we can get  a  D like  a  Caravan ,Uhhuh 
C but  seems like the jury system  does have its advantages  ,D Well   my   my  real feeling   about   about  the purpose of undergraduate education is its really the time  
D gosh  you can ride a bike laughter practically all the way to Southern Virginia ,Okay  
you would   ,it really was  
F Oh  my goodness these guys  they ,Uhhuh  
Uhhuh ,Uhhuh 
C so  I think ,no  
Uhhuh , in the  house   
C and  ,  I  F um  I   I   have both because  that  thats  what I use all the time is UNIX Systems  F Um  versus the DOS  
They F uh   , E I mean   Im  not  not  saying at all that  Hussein wasnt quite willing to  ge   enter  that fight 
In Panama theyve been used to Americans down there for so darn long  ,D Now  I havent seen it either  
C and  she has flower gardens and bulbs perennials and things  ,C But   I like  I like   the older ones because at that time D you know  they were really futuristic D you know  
 boy  ,D you know  laughter childtalking 
C but  those are the ones that are complaining A  I  I  think  a lot  ,C but  thats just  
  you just   it hurts to breathe  ,C and  we got some great public works out of it  
C and   I believe  that  D you know  that    I do believe that  capital punishment is F uh  alternative  ,you go first 
throatclearing,C but  that was our general tendency anyway 
As in metric size hole  or a  or an  American sized hole ,Ive only been camping twice 
 F uh   a professional singer  ,  I  
   C S   C s    C so   you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system noise ,really 
C and  its pretty large , That  that  had not occurred to me 
C But  were ,F Uh  it  s just   D you know  doesnt  seem to have enough story to it 
  I  I   I  dont ,Uhhuh 
F Oh  yeah ,Im not sure where all my pins came from  
F uh  my main opinion would be   w  w   we  should not have done it , C but  
yeah childtalking  ,F Oh  okay  
C but   ,Really  
F Um  ye  ,C and  of course people are denying it  
 C so   finally laughter  ,C and  now
like   the draft ,if they figure they have got it won or if theres no real hurry because the first three quarters or F uh   if  F uh  if   something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing   They say hey we got to do something now  And then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes 
C But  I have a hard time  of being able   of  separating  D you know   having a place   separating  my trash  ,is it restricted to certain crimes  
Uhhuh ,Yeah 
They say youre going to do it this way and thats the way its going to be , I think  I think  there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as F uh   
I would too if I had kids  ,several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day 
Uhhuh ,In fact on  weeknights they are in bed by eight  
 D Well  C but  D you know   the   the   strange thing   F uh  perhaps not strange but  something that many people dont realize  is that you can go back as far as nineteen fiftyone and fiftytwo and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids  ,I can understand that  
F Um  I enjoy F uh  a lot of  the  the  modern forms F um  F uh  ,C and  F uh  we all look forward to it 
Im not saying that they were,yeah laughter 
right  ,uhhuh 
 I   I  see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it ,C but  hopefully I will be able to get back to the slopes some day  
F Uh  Dallas is having quite a few  ,Now  thats   its  all over with D you know  
 where were  ,Yeah 
C but  F um  I dont know D you know   ,I started to see at home  
D Well  theres so many people who have never D you know  even gotten to do that ,C and  I dont want to wash it because that would start breaking down the batting  and so forth  
Oh ,All those  old good ones that you D you know  wish they  had on  
it is  ,Uhhuh 
C but  F uh  thats how Im staying up , and  
Laughter F Uh  ,Yeah  
I would try that ,Uhhuh 
Uhhuh , Byebye  
Yeah  ,F um  I think that that would be  a real  a real  F uh  advantage  to  to  her to have that and F uh 
 C and  theyre all in boxes or bags  ,C because  D see  I didnt D see   
C And  F uh  I guess we just like to go  someplace  someplace  entirely different  ,Right 
C and  they cant decide for hours unless they convince that one person D you know  , C so   C But    D you know  it works I guess 
Theres nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person  ,The prices D actually  a lot better because Pittsburgh is about the size A Ive been trying to think  like a Louisville or  Minneapolis that type of size 
Oh laughter ,Uhhuh 
Yeah ,C And then    you s  y   y   
working on your own self ,C so  its kind of  a  a   typo that for than  unfair advantage
Yeah ,yeah laughter 
C And then  you think E I mean   I ha   E I mean  I can remember I have  not been out of school that long  , you  you  just have to  pick something for  the  the  group that youre going to entertain for that particular time 
D Well  thats kind of what weve always been told D you know  theyll do  ,Yeah  
     I am not for one world government  ,Really 
On the other hand F um  I think theres certainly some professions that ought to be tested ,C and  they  
Uhhuh ,Its just  thing   a part  of everyones consciousness 
I run into people every day that cant speak English ,Uhhuh  
 Laughter We found this one area that doesnt have mosquitoes  ,Okay  
C so  her budget is F uh  just F uh  planning for I R As ,C and  laughter  we just did  we would make   
C But  probably F uh  D you know  more women being  in  in  the work force also greatly greatly affects social change ,D Well  F uh    yo    I    F uh  Im  kind of young  
Right breathing ,Oh yeah  
Uhhuh , Uhhuh   
F Uh  clothes are getting  so expensive now  in  in  the stores  ,I think most of the time the kids are usually off  watching cartoons or playing video games or  stuff   stuff  like that 
 with them and so forth  ,right  
Right  , Uhhuh   
C and  I dont  have D you know  big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards because that interest  rate just is a killer ,Which is just F uh  in trouble 
Smack  C So  I dont have a fear of fire arms in any respect ,I like to watch him 
C and  I went  ,So were really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers 
Do you watch L A LAW ,C So   I  Bush  is probably if he can keep that correlation together especially the French and the British and the Germans and be sure that the Japanese can kick in some of their money  
Uhhuh ,you have to be a certain income holder to F uh  have an American Express  card  
I do  ,Okay  
It was really nice ,C but  F uh  lipsmack I dont have F uh  Jack laughter standing behind me to tell me what to do laughter 
F Um   it takes some  it takes some  dedication  to do it  , It  she thought it  was going to  
A lot of the northern states and a lot of the Eastern states have bottles  ,Uhhuh 
C And  I got about   two  twothirds  of it done , and if I am not going to D you know 
The last  ,Dont they usually tell you to say something 
theres a lot of people that are on death row, Uhhuh   
 I  I  guess I am disappointed with Dallas in that F uh  the fourteen one it  ,F uh  I find myself listening to popular music  
C so  you cant use it anyway ,When we were  
F Uh  the main point that I have about choosing where you want to go to school is that  def  you have to early on define  what it is you want to do , when is it happening and where is it happening  
Laughter,C or  were they reabsorbed  
D You know  what wed really like  if   if   we just have  a   a  casual evening is Houstons  , Yeah  
C But  D you know  same F uh   , Yep  
Waco to me  seems  seems  like its pretty steady  ,Yeah  
Uhhuh ,I didnt notice it  
All right ,C so  D you know  they would be pretty elaborate 
 it gives you a different laughter perspective on what people do ,C But  F uh  thats great  
course  when our  big ones were little we lived up north D you know   ,Right 
Laughter,Next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile  
C So  I dont mow grass or anything like that  ,Take care 
 to us  ,I put in so much money each D you know  month towards long term savings D you know  like in F uh  mutual funds and things D you know  
Yeah ,  there isnt  
its very prevalent  ,Yeah  
 E I mean  you could go into a store and   get bombarded ,I think its because hes always heard music in our home  all the  since  he was a baby 
Uhhuh , urban society   
I could not believe it ,yes   
 Yeah  ,Yeah 
F Uh  I like the Giants  ,C But    I  sigh it   it  seems to me that it still should  
F Um  its just like up there when you hear its forty below its probably really only five below ,Uhhuh 
Hart , Uhhuh   
 F huh  thats   ,Oh yeah 
 I  hardly ever watch it  ,the children thoroughly enjoy 
C But  F uh  D you know  basically the guy commits D you know  three major crimes   and   and    F uh , before I  went to work and stuff  
C and   they  theyre   making furniture and just D you know  things like  that during the winter  ,F Uh  we have two and another one on the way 
Uhhuh , like  that  
if we supported each other,when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought
Uhhuh  ,that kind of  to me it is more like    vigilantism   
C and  ,An English setter D you know   
I do not ,C so  I was caught a little off guard  
C but   it is ,Im sure until at least school age and maybe longer 
 C and  it is true  ,Yeah  
D You know   I want to  I want to  throw some charcoal on the grill  and  and  throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and  stuff like that  ,Laughter
Uhhuh ,Ive noticed people doing that down here too  
yes maam ,C and   we   our whole house  has D you know   
C and  F uh  ,Yeah   
 It is  it is  really scary ,Oh 
Because I think a little infant just does not get the stimulation they need ,Laughter Yeah  
C and  I thought D wow  that might be interesting ,D You know  every time you do that it F uh  kind of kills the tree for a while 
Even when you tell them no they keep calling back , teaches  teaches  a lot  
in fact did you happen to see TWENTY TWENTY the other night ,D Well   Charles will actually    Charles will  not smoke in anyone elses house except our own 
 hes ,C so   F Um  anyway let me press one 
F Oh  good idea ,Its what information is presented  
C Because   that   that  just reminds me of D you know  D like  back in school  , It does  
C but  I dont know what they can do to really prevent it D you know   ,Im ready when you are 
C but  F uh  football  soon as its fall then he likes ,F Huh   
C but  F um    if you   F um     if   if     you    want to go into one thats really useful breathing youre going to have to go over a thousand dollars  ,Laughter
F Uh  what are you thinking about buying ,Huh 
 was a friend that you know did it in hum sounds like an airplane their house that I knew well ,Uhhuh 
 we cant  we cant  balance a checkbook without a calculator ,C And  F uh  D you know  you could do a lot of it yourself still  
D Well   what  what  changes  would you   have you considered F uh  in doing it  to  to  your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better ,Yeah  
 C And   C  and   F uh  then an uncle is dead  ,E I mean  its not so serious I guess until it affects your family  
C and  the idea that D you know   if he got in trouble theres  some   some  ways of getting out and that he doesnt  have to carry cash  ,Yeah 
Uhhuh ,Laughter Not always  
I dont know ,Are you from Dallas area 
D Actually   they were  the guy was  pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the E P A ,we use my husbands 
C And so   it   it  works out nice  ,Definitely when its cool 
youre right  ,C But  we have F uh   
Yeah ,C But  it turns out that F uh  Foster actually F uh  ghost wrote it for him 
C but  F uh  D you know ,Throatclearing
Right ,Yeah  
I always thought itd be great to have twins , the facts would probably back it up  
Uh the causes of crime  ,I   Im   just read two books  
F Uh  automatically  ,Uhhuh 
C so   he went  D like  F uh  I think he went  D well  five mornings a week if I remember correctly ,It was F uh  several years  ago  
Uhhuh ,C so  about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too D you know

I  ,A kid in  
 C And   F uh  C so   I wasnt directly involved  , Laughter Yeah  
 I  I  think our seven year old  even  e   once in a while will sit down and watch it ,D Well  I think thats all I have to say

C and  it seems that theyve gotten over their bickering and their fighting as  they   problems they  had in the past  ,Were supposed to talk about crime in the city 
Yeah  ,the only way you could use them is if you were  D like  on vacation  
 more related to New Jersey than it is to like Rochester New York  those  that  kind of thing ,C and  we didnt think wed have much chance of getting in  
Uhhuh ,are  both want  the extent of extremes so that they dont give anything for a balance
C but  F uh  Im just curious what he has to say now that theyve got them all lit ,Uhhuh 
Yeah , to see if theres anything thats consistent on that

C and then  I paint around it  ,Yeah 
D Well  we F uh  remodeled a bathroom,F Oh  yeah

C and so  my dont change dramatically over the years  ,Uhhuh

 Just F uh   ,Yes  
C And  it really made a difference static to us ,Youve never seen NORTHERN EXPOSURE 
 C And  something else that I would ,Yeah  
Of course life is a lot more complicated too in ways F um   ,Its  a   a  missions organization  and F uh  doing F uh  translation linguistics that sort of thing 
In Durham which is right next to Raleigh ,That I dont think I could do anyway  
C so  D you know  I think that   it   a trial by your peers should be exactly that someone in your own age bracket  ,We got free tickets because  someone at our church    one of the deacons at church  F um  parks cars at The Mansion at Turtle Creek  which is D like  one of  the   F uh  the  places and stuff 
Cough,Thats kind of like what wed like to do  
C And so  now   we  we   we  branch out at this Wendys or laughter some other fast food joint ,C And  
Theyre not owning homes period ,C And   it was  I was  almost more reluctant of letting my older children go babysit for her because I didnt know her

C And    I  I  never  I   didnt want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldnt do it anymore laughter ,Everything we had was in boxes  
Yeah ,Oh 
Yes ,C And then  when you get one of those tornado type 
 its  its  a gamble  ,Theyre not going to change that to meters  
C So  there was no repercussion at all  D You know  other than insurance  ,I guess it just depends on how they manage it 
 F Uh   C and    C and    D you know  some people might not believe that  ,F Um   I  
If you can control those three areas then are you going to live longer D you know  cause those are risk factors  ,C so  I cant say that
C but  I built a small deck in the back ,D You know   all those things that really could be changed  that arent  D you know   that  that   arent   
D now   I  weve  been there twice  C and   C and   both times  I just  F oh  the food just  didnt quite settle with me  ,He goes do you want to dance  
I would think it wouldnt be D you know  much more than the eighteen or  nineteen percent everyone else charges ,F Oh  thats sad 
 or an  id  individual  perhaps being single ,D Well  we really miss   Utah laughter

Uhhuh ,D Well  Im a little bit ambivalent  
C and  its still  ,uhhuh

D So  F um   do you think that you  do you think that your  family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter ,C because  they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to  
at least half of the residents I would say are  not  not  mentally sound  ,My neighbor A lets see  is Jewish  
Bye ,F Oh  I love them like that 
  C But  you laughter   C so  you   know what  Im saying  ,C And then  she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty  as of last Friday

 kind of thing ,Uhhuh  
 Right  ,Pretty good 
C but  its a charity for the benefit of this shelter ,C and  I think  if  F uh  if  we just start to put D you know  the nickel deposit on things like F uh  was the case years ago that F uh  it would have more immediate effect F uh   than

C But   F uh  I believe Israel does that  dont they for their ,Yes  
 that work and the percentage  of hours that they work and how that affects their grades  ,F Uh  I guess my particular beef is that having participated in the  mi  military  off and on  over the  over the   years of being called back and things of that nature is F uh   Ive found that D you know  theres an extraordinary amount of waste  
ignore the others , I stay wi  I have to stay within   it

C And  I always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything,F Uh    you know  you know   you know  what I mean  
 C And   C and    , C and    C and   its  just great

C And then  the power went off again  ,Okay 
Youre at ,It certainly is frightening  
C and  this has been a couple of years ago ,Breathing laughter F Um   that reminded me of a place for lunch thats a little off the beaten track  
 C and   F um  C so   he sat down  ,All rightie

F Oh  uhhuh , E I mean  youve got to do something 
 C and  the   C and  the   economy is so bad  ,  C And   F uh  C so   there have been major major adjustments 
D Well  ,D well  we try  
theres a Swan Club which is out Central and Campbell ,F Oh  okay 
it was Buddy Ryan the one that I cant F uh  F uh  stand too much ,simply because  
we kind of had  planned this F uh  trek to the east, they  they  have really been rationed on their water  
Sure ,D so   
  C And   C and     C and   it  ,Right 
 C So   C and   I really do wish I knew about quotas and really wish I  ,Yeah babytalking 
 its   D like  I  dont know when the police has their project going  ,because different school systems have got more or less money to take care of that sort of thing 
Right ,I have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing  
How many F uh  ,Weve got a good video place out here  
F Uh  how do you mean that Laughter ,Yeah

Yeah  ,Uhhuh 
C And  the equipment we were capturing and taking from the Nicaraguans was brand new out of the crate Soviet made material  ,Yeah  
Uhhuh  ,Right laughter 
I wish that they would  D you know  realize that  they  they  couldnt make this kind of money  ,  D like  the oaks  D like   the white oaks  seem to be pretty hardy  
Exactly ,F Um  D actually  when I was younger  I was a Cardinal fan too 
C but ,if Id do something be motivated enough to do something  I think it would work out well 
 Are  they  Laughter ,And uh whether those diseases can yo  
Uhhuh ,Yeah 
 C And   F uh ,Well Im thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old  
C but  ,C and  he said that people have no idea he said  of  of  what human sacrifice is D you know   
C And  thats  ,C But  if we took these people  off  off   the streets for a year there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation  for everyone else  
So that F uh   we can make  theyre making  some  more intelligent decisions  ,Its just D you know 
 because there are so many avenues that needs  to be F um  undertaken in a program like that  ,Uhhuh 
D So  do you have any recycling programs there ,C And  F uh  D you know  when you have  a  a  voice you do contribute  
Hes going to do what he wants to do ,Yeah

Yeah  ,F Oh  Italian I guess 
one thing you know that I always think about when I think of public education  ,C and  F uh  he D you know   
C But     it  it   F uh  all the rooms   are small E I mean   ,C and then  as the car goes by you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it  
Laughter Yeah ,My sister used to live  there 
F Um  lipsmack F uh  lets what else we do  ,For her to get home and  try to run at six oclock in the night in the winter time its starting to get dark

can really ,where nobody wants
Yes F um   , Okay   
C And  you end up owing D you know   ,at the end  
 C and   F uh  C and   that sort of forced them  ,That seems to be our biggest problem down here  
my husbands family had  a  a  motor boat F uh   when we got engaged  ,F uh  
We kind of give her the third degree Laughter ,D Well  you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about  
 C and    C and   we had a dinner party before we started renovating it  ,D well  
 C and   we dont really care about you,Right 
C but  ,C but  F uh  I dont know

Laughter,C And  that movie  I have to   Ill  fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is  
All right ,You found some members of your church that had been murdered 
I guess your dress changes ,its great  
 tends to get like HEADLINE NEWS if you listen to it for an hour       , Sure   
C or  after tax year nineteen ninety theres no deductions for D you know   credit card interest that you pay ,C And  I was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay  home and maybe be wage earners for their family  
D You know  E I mean    I  I   Ive  never liked credit cards , C but   
C And   his old day care as much as I loved it D you know  , how would it    how   what  kind of stuff     would they   would you     like them to do so  that   that  you would know more about it

C And  it was ,this morning in our paper  it   there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a drivers license  
we were thinking about getting   cat  ,Theyre uh they almost have what I would call a killer e killer bee instinct 
I think theyll be a cultural shock  ,C So  you got to give them either more time  in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better  
F Oh  yeah ,I guess if you had some really complicated stuff  
C But   it always seems  static D well  it just felt  different D like  when we were in Texas  ,Yes 
Estes State Park is fantastic ,Yeah

C and  when thats over with  thats  thats  it without even giving a second thought to       advancing their education or getting extracurricular F um  education  ,There are very few Scouts go on
C and  F uh  the only responsibility  of the  of the  patron is to separate them  ,C and  thats mostly to decide whether or not the persons actually going to stand trial 
thats really neat  ,Yeah  
C or  they D you know   have  have  spirit week  that  that  you wear your different outfits  , D well  it was the equivalent of a Christmas present 
Yeah  ,over them as uh
  I  I    in fact I  was in Texas for a little while ,C and  you have  some success and want to go on learning and continue learning  F uh   
 C and then  look at the weather we have down here  ,At first I was thinking it was just a week because thats all it shows D you know  on the schedule

C and  it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it  ,C And   of course D you know  you have  the  F uh  the  weeds that come up in  between the bricks  or  and  things like  that 
It was really nice that they had F um  that  ,Sniffing Of course we wouldnt have the retail market we have either

I think D you know  one of the things   that  that   that  needs to happen is F uh   to  to  stop the impulse buyer from F uh  buying it quickly  and  and  F uh ,Uhhuh 
C and  F um  it sounds really neat  it really does ,C but  I can talk to the teacher and tell them on a pretty good basis after Ive worked up at the school for a couple of weeks

F Um  ,Weve got enough  without lea  without  a passport

 C But   F uh  C and     hes   D you know  he tries  his best  ,Uhhuh 
I think thats just the biggest problem is keeping it  in  in  front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is and how important it is to do that ,F Uh  actually one thing we have done quite  a bit through the holidays just because its  a   real easy is just baked potato dinners 
Uhhuh , further cut the taxes and  created D you know    that  that    that    D you know   created the  huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar  deficit

it seems like most people like spaghetti ,See I was raised in the Midwest which
 C And  it finally  got motheaten  ,E I mean  if you can D you know    y  y    the trial is supposed to prove D you know   within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty

I dont like to have a lot of things out D you know   just all over the place , and see exactly whats happening

No  ,Yeah   aa
Yeah  ,C so  thats sort of related to her field  a little bit  
C so  when I was home I still cooked a lot  ,C So   I  what I   said that I wasnt being real facetious about that

There is more energy in it per pound or  whatever  ,Uhhuh 
Uhhuh ,  I dont  I dont  know

E I mean   the  theyre  throwing more money at it now than ever before  ,D well  Im sure

Thats rough  , You think youd  you think youd  F uh  go up in space if you had a chance 
if you have  young    young  children D you know   they   they  get a kick out of it ,C So  thats probably my  favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation 
 o  only    in  D like  in   the common areas and in the island ,C or  
but but there could be some work done in the area ,F Uh  chiming cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget Not only for buying them but for keeping them on the road too 
 D you know   ,C So   that  thats   the only thing I think that might be a little bit of a problem 
You should still be sniffing babycrying ,C And  F uh  D now  brakes Ive always done a lot of D you know  changing brakes

C And  F uh  what about you ,I think its seventyfive dollars for me and forty  for him 
 Laughter  ,F Oh  goodness 
I saw him yesterday morning over there  ,C but  I decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date 
C So  laughter ,Really  
Wow ,Uhhuh 
we all need that time,I think its like ninetynine point ninetynine think it is  percent  
C but   maybe F uh   ,where do you go 
Ive lived in so  many places  ,my current project is a walkway which Im building around the house and out to the backyard  to   F uh  D you know  digging it out and laying sand and  putting F uh  pavers on top of that  
 Huh   ,F Oh  yeah  
they say when youre done youre done  ,Okay  
I work with noise computers ,C So  laughter 
Yeah  ,Will it be mandatory

F Uh  C  so  its like I said spending money doesnt guarantee you F uh  winning a pennant ,Noise Right 
C And then  they take these things that will rust  , Prob  probably  right  if you look at it from that stand point 
They knew the sucker when they saw one  ,F Huh  
 whatever ,it is  
Colorado Springs specifically  ,theres a lot of air pollution 
D like   in  in   , Dont assume   always assume  its loaded  
 is  theres  a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in , Sunday  afternoon  
C And  I love it   , C And    F uh  C so   thats interesting 
Where did you go to school ,The people are different  
C and ,You sound like youve got some small ones in the background 
Theres a lot of things  that they dont do in school anymore  , C but  I also have two that are just entering school  
F Uh  we found some guys that actually D you know  worked for a Mercedes  dealership  ,Yeah  
not going to  run again after this  ,Oh I know 
C so  I guess  I  I  feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems ,my oldest is his first year in high school  
 now   that   that   thats  what I would like,  I   I  lived in places D like   
 Uhhuh  ,F Oh  D well  hes outside

Yeah  ,Uhhuh 
Uhhuh , you  you  F uh  get left out of the loop more  
C but   at   it  ,That was weird wasnt it 
Uhhuh  ,F Ah  
 I think   we have to accept the fact that whatever happens were going to have to bite the bullet  ,Uhhuh  
F Oh  I think that they should go ahead and go to the F uh  fourteen one  ,Uhhuh 
 C And  we ended up with  these    these  D like  things on the cantaloupe vines that E I mean   were   looked  like  round big huge round cucumbers ,It was really good 
C so  its kind of different ,Uhhuh 
Right ,D Well  it depends on  whether you  whether we  figure  that we have  that we have  a defense oriented military or 
Leading Edge will say well buy it from you ,Yeah  
C But  thats the second one  of   of  those that weve had  ,C and  F uh  D you know   I finally D you know  paid them all off and  thought this is D you know  kind of nonsense   
 Yeah  ,C and   they were talking D like 
 Do they not ever  A I mean I dont know that much  Do they not ever  burn trash or anything like , that was really small  
Uhhuh  ,F Uh  ha

uhhuh ,Uhhuh 
Uhhuh  ,Uhhuh 
You work at T I ,C But   F uh  D anyway  I dont know  
C and  he would get the glory though no king no  ,Yeah 
Uhhuh ,I remember I saw him in a huge stadium in F uh  Philadelphia  
 Uhhuh  ,D Well  you learn a lot of F um   skills too  
Yeah , Oh

D Well  the French went in and tried their old style warfare and F uh  got soundly thrashed  ,She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town

 C And    F uh  I had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where ,Democracy 
I dont ever remember of course D you know  you only remember the good stuff  ,D Now  maybe D you know   thats pretty close to what it would have sold for F uh  brand new  
Yep ,Right 
Right ,Salvia 
 Id say  Id say  at twentytwo you dont necessarily need a plan as long as youre   getting  getting  the exercise otherwise , including a number of people from out in California 
C and  I guess it went defunct recently ,C So  we all get to go to our own little  thing and drive through and get our own thing 
Yeah  ,I agree with you there 
C but   thats  I think thats  a good magazine ,Yeah 
I think breathing thats the hardest thing  ,Definitely seen it  do    on  on    during the day down there    
D You know  C because  other states quite a bi  a chunk out for F uh  city  and  state taxes  ,a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea D you know  even that theres an election  
F Uh  right now Im in Utah  , C or  F uh   
Yeah  ,D Now  
It would seem to spread it out a  little better if the employers who F uh  employ these people and pay them F uh   D you know  subminimum wages or whatever,Yeah 
 C and   C so    F uh  theres a lot of money to be made there  , C and  we  were   kept saying wouldnt it be great if we could find another one just like it 
I think Ive seen most of Humphrey Bogarts movies  but  in  in   D you know  a long time ago ,My husband is a hunter fisherman outdoorsman Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog  
and  just things   any  any  eating area  that you just dont have to wait an extreme amount of time ,Oh

an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use ,Yeah 
theres no ,C And  with medicine being the way it is youre extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down  
Yes , I enjoy  I enjoy  going to the beach and to beach areas  
Huh ,in fact we have a ten year old grandson   that    
I know laughter  ,C So  you have no children at all

Laughter,We went years ago  
E I mean  I just try and make it on that ,Laughter
they could be ,Yeah  
F Oh   thats interesting  ,It was like John Feinstein or something like that 
C and  whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full you close the box its already bundled its already done for you , C so  by the end of this coming year whats going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government pounding
